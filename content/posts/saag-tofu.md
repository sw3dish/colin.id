## Instructions
### For the tofu
1. Preheat the oven to 400F.

4. Chop the tofu into 1 inch cubes.
5. Coat the tofu with olive oil, tossing with a spatula.
6. Mix spices with cornstarch to incorporate.
7. Sprinkle the tofu with cornstarch mixture, tossing to coat.
8. Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, ensuring no pieces touch.
9. Bake for 30 minutes, turning every 10 minutes.

### For the saag
1. Finely chop spinach using a food processor.
2. Dice onion and chile.
3. Sauté onion in coconut oil over medium heat until softened.
4. Add chile, garlic, and ginger and cook until fragrant.
5. Stir in coriander and cumin and cook briefly.
6. Add spinach and coconut milk.
7. Continue cooking until most of the liquid is absorbed, season with salt and pepper to taste.

### Assemble
1. Combine saag and tofu. Serve immediately, topping with diced onion and diced tomato.
