2. Dice onion and chile.
3. Saut√© onion in coconut oil over medium heat until softened.
4. Add chile, garlic, and ginger and cook until fragrant.
5. Stir in coriander and cumin and cook briefly.
6. Add spinach and coconut milk.
7. Continue cooking until most of the liquid is absorbed, season with salt and pepper to taste.
