I've been lifting consistently for about 5 years, mostly with powerlifing programs (Stronglifts, Ketogains, 5/3/1).
I'm at a point where I'm pretty happy with my PRs (minus my bench) and feel like I'm not going to make a ton of
progress without a.) gaining more weight that I'm comfortable with and b.) risking injury or constant soreness.
So, I'm in the market for a new program -- mostly focused on hypertrophy, but retaining most of my strength (even if
my PRs won't go up).

## My criteria

What am I looking for in a program?

First, I'm looking to balance hypertrophy with strength. I like getting a pump, but
also feel like I'm wasting my time if I'm not lifting close to my max occasionally.

Second, I'd like to lift 4-6 times a week. Any fewer and I feel restless and over-recovered.
Only with very high volume programs like 5/3/1 Building the Monolith do I feel like I need the
recovery that 3 sessions a week allows for.

Along with that, I'd like to keep my sessions to fewer than 100 minutes.
Combined with my walk to the gym (about 30 minutes round-trip), ~2.25 hours
is the maximum amount of time I'd like to spend on this hobby.

Third, I want to be able to bring my experience and preferences to adapt the program to my liking.
After 5 years, I know what I like and what I don't. I have a rough idea of what works for me and
what's a waste of time. For example, I know I like compound lifts and super sets; I know I dislike overcomplicated
setups with bands.

## My goals

I have a few points of my physique that I'd like to improve or at least train more consistently than
I've been using other programs.

1. My back has always been a strong point in terms of recovery. I can pour volume into it and
be ready to train again within a day or two. However, I want to improve back thickness.
**I'll incorporate Meadows rows, supported rows, etc. to focus on isolating my lats and mid back.**

2. Delts, delts, delts. I feel they're essentially to building an aesthetic taper and I've noticed that
most powerlifting programs neglect them since they're not essential to the big three. **I want to do more
delt work than just barbell overhead pressing, especially focusing on side delts and rear delts**

3. Legs. My legs have always been a strong point in terms of strength, but I've never felt that they've looked
the part. **Plan to incorporate more time-under-tension and volume into quads and hamstrings**

4. Triceps. Like many lifters, I think I spent too much time early on focusing on biceps or neglecting arms
altogether. **High volume is key here, focusing on feeling the stretch and squeeze and avoiding using either
shoulders/chest to cheat the movement**

## The program

With all that in mind, I've landed on an adaptation of PHAT (Power/Hypertrophy Adaptive Training) from Layne Norton.
The rough breakdown of PHAT is that you lift 5 days per week -- 2 of them power days (upper/lower) and
3 of them hypertrophy days (chest + arms/back + shoulders/legs).

It hits my goals of balancing strength and hypertrophy and is right in the middle of the frequency range
that I'd like to stay within.

However, the prescribed (possibly recommended?) exercises are where I'll deviate.
Norton favors dumbbell bench presses over barbell bench presses for both power and hypertrophy and
does not include any main exercises in the power days for deadlifting.

I briefly thought about upping the power days to three, one for shoulders + back and one for chest and back,
but I worry about recovery with only one rest day. So, I'll give my front delts a rest from overhead pressing and hope
that incline bench + bench covers it.

Deadlifts are easy to incorporate by just adding to the lower power day and alternating between weeks as to which
comes first in the day.

Massive amount of text, but big things are:
- Decent amount of accessory exercises, usually done in superset
- Incorporating pauses and slow eccentrics on hypertrophy days
- Training side and rear delts three times a week
- Eliminating barbell rows from back training (I find I use my legs too much and my lower back doesn't like it)
- Highly reducing front delt training, relying on bench/incline bench
