# Nutrition: a spectrum

This is a deep dive into how I eat, currently and in the past. I'm also going
to explain why I eat the things I do -- sometimes science-backed, but mostly
I eat to fuel my performance either in the gym or to improve mental health.
So -- you might see some weird stuff.

## College (2014 - March 2018)

I had a very poor diet in college. I ate a lot of processed foods, fast foods, and 
drank a lot of alcohol. I don't think I drank that much water (not that I drank
a lot of soda or juices). One could describe this as a standard American diet (SAD).

As you might guess, this caused me to gain an extreme amount of weight over 4 years,
about 50 pounds. I had a few stints of attempting to eat more healthily and even a short
stint at the gym, but nothing stuck and I ended up ~225 pounds a few months before graduation.

## Keto, OMAD, and weight loss (March 2018 - September 2018)

Right around March before I graduated, I decided to lose weight. I had run out of excuses
to stay so overweight -- I was about to finish my degree, had a job lined up, and all of my
extracurricular and leadership activities were coming to an end.

This was right around the time keto was getting very big on Reddit and I thought it'd be
a way for me to lose weight but still eat things that I liked.

The prevailing opinion was that you could ignore tracking calories and still lose weight --
while I believe that satiation from fats and protein can be self-regulating, that's probably not going to
work to lose a consistent amount of weight.

So, pairing keto and tracking calories and macros, I lost ~50 pounds between March and September of 2018.

I ate a standard keto diet, with ~75% of my calories coming from fat and the other 25% coming from protein.
This usually came from cheese, eggs, red meat (ribeyes, strip steaks) or processed meats (bacon, sausage, salami).
I believe I ate some vegetables -- mostly spinach as it has few carbs.
There is a small allotment for net carbs, and those usually came from protein bars. I still drank alcohol, 
usually clear liquor (gin, vodka) which usually has no carbs.

During this time, I noticed that I didn't really miss sweets, but I missed things like bread and potatoes a lot.

## Relaxing dieting (September 2018 - early 2019)

After losing that amount of weight, I didn't want to gain it all back (unlike the 80 to 95% of dieters).
So, while I relaxed my strict keto requirements, I also didn't go off the deep end and return back
to my old generally processed diet. But to be honest, I don't remember much of what I ate from this period.
I know I went to Korea during winter of 2018 and gained a decent amount of weight eating pastries and fried
Korean foods.

## Beginning lifting (February 2019 - )

## Apex Predator diet (March 2023 - May 2023)
The Apex Predator diet is fairly simple. 5 to 6 
What an unfortunate name for what I think is a perfectly fine diet. The author's suprisingly not a 

## High protein is queen, semi-vegetarianism? (May 2023 - ?)
I've found that high protein has allowed me to consistently improve my lifts, while maintaining a steady
amount of weight loss/easy time maintaining.

The 4 to 5 whey protein shakes are staying, as they provide a basis of 200 to 250 grams of protein. I'll be
shooting for at least 300 grams of protein a day, going up to 400 if possible.

However, the huge amount of red meat I'm intaking makes me slightly uncomfortable. While I'm not 
convinced red meat has intrinsic properties that make it bad for my health (rather, I believe 
red meat when combined with other aspects of a SAD may be unhealthy), there are other factors driving me away from it.

First, it's getting really expensive.
My preferred cuts of meat, steaks like ribeyes or flank steak or flap meat, have been steadily climbing
since the pandemic. It's a little hard for me to stomach eating 20 - 30 dollars of meat every day.

After some introspection, I've also been a bit more conscious of my environmental impact and am trying to live a more
"sustainable" life, whatever that may look like. Big sources of inspiration are 100rabbits, 

Restricting to meat is also fairly limiting for one of my favorite hobbies -- cooking. Marinades are great

Finally, eating just meat and protein shakes meshes poorly with a social life. Sometimes you can get around it; at restaurants
ordering just meat and vegetables, timing outings with cheat/relaxed days; but ultimately, it's inconvenient. Dating's a minefield
as you have to lead with this highly restrictive diet that pieces of would only appeal to hardened meat-eaters.
This is pretty uncommon in Brooklyn! Lots of vegans or at least people that eschew red meat.

So, as I don't mind eating tofu, tempeh, etc. and I don't buy into the dangers of phytoestrogens in the diet, I'm planning
to replace the red meat that I eat at home with tofu, tempeh, seitan or other analogues. I do want to stay away from
highly processed vegan/vegetarian foods, as I believe that my issues with weight gain are
tied more to processed foods and, especially, processed carbs.

On carbs, I will be increasing them substantially -- likely to around 200/250 grams a day. I think
that my ability to sustain output in the gym, either long sets (8-15 reps) or HIIT/cardio, has been
impacted negatively after cutting carbs out. While carb restriction is definitely not untenable for me while
lifting, I'm going to up the carbs to see if I can make even greater improvements.
