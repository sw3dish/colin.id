## Using Elixir
I've finally finished [statisch](https://github.com/sw3dish/statisch) which I used to generate this site.
I'd been learning about Ecto and its support of embedded schemas and used changesets to enforce validation on my structs.

There are a few more improvements I'd like to make -- I miss Django's templating language and am thinking about writing a
DSL to extend EEx to add support for partials and blocks. I also want to move it from an `escript` to a full-blown
`mix` application, with commands to create a new site, new post, etc. and deploy.

After the generation part is finished, I want to start enforcing accessibility and performance
as well as having the site be automatically archived on Archive.org.

I'm using Phoenix to create a bookmarking/link + article archival tool along the lines of Pinboard. Elixir + Phoenix are a joy
to use and, with a sprinkling of [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/), make it easy to get stuff done.

## Weightlifting
I've been doing the Olympic lifts (at least the snatch and clean) for the last 6 months. Definitely enjoying them, definitely
need to practice more! But I've hit a 135 snatch and a 215 clean, so I'm happy with how I'm picking them up.

The programming that I've been doing has also been doing wonders for my deadlift -- 
hit a 450 sumo deadlift and a 435 conventional deadlift -- after being stuck for a couple years at 405.
Squat holds strong at a 365 high-bar squat and overhead press is at a nice 135 for a triple.
I'd love to improve my bench, which sits at 235, but the olympic lifts are taking precedence.
